## Hacker News Search Client

Hacker News <https://news.ycombinator.com/> is a great site run by the famous venture
capital firm Y Combinator. It allows people to submit articles and comment on them. It also
provides a nice web interface to search through its history or articles.
Your task is to build a web app that allows the user to search for articles on a topic and
display the results.

Details of the Search API can be found here. <https://hn.algolia.com/api>
